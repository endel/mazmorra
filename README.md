## [Mazmorra.io](https://mazmorra.io): Retro Multiplayer Roguelite RPG

[Mazmorra.io](https://mazmorra.io) has a long history with Colyseus. This project has started to validate the very first vesions of Colyseus, as you can see in [commits dating back from 2015](https://github.com/endel/mazmorra/commit/7d2f631a48f8907f5031a3c9a1936d012bbe2090), when the Colyseus version was **0.2**

I've decided to make the **source code available** for mazmorra.io, for educational purposes. It is not open-sourced under a permissive license, though. You are **not allowed** to host your own version, or a modified version of [Mazmorra.io](https://mazmorra.io).

Beware. There are a lot of bad code and bad practices in here, which I'm not very proud of.
